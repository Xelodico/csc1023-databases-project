## üí° Features

- **20 Fully Normalised Entities**: Storing information on applicants, employers, and job applications.
- **SQL Views**: Created for business requirements, including application feedback.
- **Java Application**: Used for database interaction.
  - **Note**: The application will not work for you as it requires being run on a specific network. Nonetheless, I've included it for reference.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation is provided.
